# Smart Agriculture : Weather and Crop Yield Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to **forecast weather conditions and crop yield** at the **month, year, state, and district levels**. By combining **meteorological datasets** with **agricultural data**, the model provides insights that can aid **farmers, policymakers, and researchers** in making data-driven decisions for sustainable agriculture.

The core of the project leverages **time-series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** to capture temporal dependencies in weather and crop production patterns. The solution includes a **data pipeline** for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization of results.
